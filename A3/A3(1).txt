CMPE/CISC 365 Assignment 3

Due Nov. 30 11:59 pm.

In this assignment you'll write a dynamic programming algorithm to
compute a minimum-area triangulation between two contours in 3D.

There are two data files: testSlices.dat and femurSlices.dat.  You can
see them by running the code as

    python3 main.py femurSlices.dat

Press '?' in the window to see what keystrokes and mouse movements you
can use.

Undergraduates may work in groups of two.  Graduate students must work
individually.

1. Get the main.py code running.  Read all of the code and understand
   how it works.

All of your coding should be done in buildTriangles().  You can add
your own functions that are called by your code inside
buildTriangles().  Do not modify any other of the provided code.

2. Implement the algorithm according to the comments in buildTriangles().

   Do your testing with testSlices.dat.  Once that's working, try your
   code on femurSlices.dat.  You can do a single slice of the femur
   data by pressing 's', then '>' or '<' to move the slice up or down,
   then 'c' to compute the VISIBLE SLICE ONLY.  If all slices are
   visible, the code will take a longer time to compute all
   triangulations.

   If you have successfully installed GLUT, you can press 'v' or 'e'
   or 't' to get the vertex, edge, and triangle identifiers shown in
   the window.  That can help with your debugging.  But you do not
   need to do this.

To submit:

   Submit two files with EXACTLY THESE NAMES.

     README.txt - containing the name, student number, and netID of each
                  person working on the assignment.  Include here any
                  comments you have for the TA. 

     main.py    - the modified code, well commented.

   YOU WILL LOSE MARKS IF YOU DO NOT SUBMIT TWO FILES WITH EXACTLY THE
   NAMES ABOVE.

   IN A GROUP OF TWO, ONLY ONE PERSON MAY SUBMIT THE ASSIGNMENT.  IF
   YOUR GROUP SUBMITS TWO ASSIGNMENTS, YOU WILL LOSE MARKS.

For marking, we will read your code for correctness, clarity, and
quality, and we will run your code.
